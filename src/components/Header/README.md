# Header Component

The Header Component directory contains a component that displays the header section of your web application. The header includes the website logo, header title, and a typed subtitle. It also provides navigation options through a navigation menu.

## Component: `Header`

The `Header` component displays the header section of your web application. It includes the following elements:

- Website logo.
- Header title.
- Typed subtitle.
- Navigation menu.

## Usage

To use the `Header` component in your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Header` component into the file where you want to include the header section.

```javascript
import Header from './Header/Header';

// ... other imports ...
```

2. Place the `Header`` component at the top of your layout to provide users with quick access to navigation and essential information.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <Header />
      {/* ... other components ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Typing Effect for Subtitle

The `Header` component implements a typing effect for the header subtitle. As the component renders, the subtitle is progressively displayed one character at a time, creating a visually appealing effect.

### Responsive Scroll Behavior

The header's appearance changes as the user scrolls down the page. On larger screens, the header is fixed and gains a shadow when scrolled, enhancing the visual transition and improving the user experience.
