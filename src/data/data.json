      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "what": "What does a Notary do?",
      "whatAnswer": "The responsibility of a notary in Texas extends to verifying the identity of signers for significant documents, ensuring their voluntary agreement without any undue pressure, and confirming their understanding of the document's purpose. In specific instances, notaries are also required to administer an oath, compelling signers to attest, under threat of legal consequences, to the accuracy and authenticity of the document's contents.",
      "noid": "What if I don't have a valid ID?",
      "noidAnswer": "In cases where a government-issued photo ID is unavailable, the requirement entails presenting TWO credible witnesses possessing valid IDs. These witnesses must affirm their personal familiarity with you and validate your identity as the individual named in the document.",
      "length": "How long does an appointment take?",
      "lengthAnswer": "The duration is contingent upon the quantity of documents and signatures necessitating notarization. Generally, the majority of notarizations conclude within 30 minutes, while real estate signings may span around an hour. Upon scheduling your appointment, I can furnish you with an approximate timeframe.",
      "late": "Can I make an appointment on weekends or after hours?",
      "lateAnswer": "Certainly, I am available for notarizations every day of the week. My standard hours are from 8am to 6pm, Monday through Friday, and from 9am to 6pm on weekends. However, I can make arrangements for additional time slots, subject to availability.",
      "re": "Can I reschedule an appointment?",
      "reAnswer": "Absolutely, life happens! Appointments can be rescheduled without incurring any extra charges up to 30 minutes before the scheduled time. If rescheduling within the last 30 minutes, I may already be en route. In such cases, kindly reach out to me at (214)616-4549."
