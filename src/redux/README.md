# Redux Folder

The Redux folder contains the implementation of a simple Redux setup for handling state management in your web application. It includes reducers and the Redux store configuration.

## File Structure

- `reducers.js`: This file contains the reducers for different sections of your application's state. It imports data from the JSON file and sets up a basic reducer for the "about" section.

- `store.js`: The Redux store is configured using the `configureStore` function from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. It combines the reducers and sets up the store with the combined reducer.

## Installation

1. Add the Redux folder to your project.

2. Ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies by following the instructions in your main README.

## Usage

### Creating Reducers

In the `reducers.js` file, you can create additional reducers as needed for different sections of your application. Modify the reducer logic inside the `switch` statement to handle different actions and state updates.

### Configuring the Store

The `store.js` file configures the Redux store using the combined reducer from `reducers.js`. You can access this store from your components to manage the application's global state.

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
});

export default store;
```

### Accessing State

You can use the `useSelector` hook from the `react-redux` library to access the state managed by Redux in your components.

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const aboutData = useSelector(state => state.about);

  // Use aboutData in your component
};
```
